# IntroToAIFinalProject
CPE-440 (Intro to AI Engineering) Final Project. Goal is to develop a CNN as well as an SVM which will classify wireless signals as 16QAM, 32QAM, or 64QAM using spectrogram images. Here is a sample spectrogram image: ![Spectrogram Example](https://github.com/mryan6/IntroToAIFinalProject/blob/master/16QAM/16QAM_1.jpg)

All data was given already pre-processed and cleaned so no data cleaning was necessary.
